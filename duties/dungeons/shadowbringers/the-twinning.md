# The Twinning

> Since its sudden appearance in Norvrandt, the Crystal Tower has been a source of great mystery, one which the people of the Crystarium have barely begun to unravel. Now that the city is free from the threat of the Lightwardens, researchers have been afforded the opportunity to explore the innermost reaches of the tower, though they soon found their way barred by hordes of ferocious guardians. An aetherial disturbance detected from inside is believed to be in some way linked to their appearance, and you have been tasked with not only clearing a path for the researchers, but with investigating the cause of the anomaly.

## Objectives

1. Arrive at Repurposing: 0/1
2. Clear Repurposing: 0/1
3. Arrive at Aetherial Observation: 0/1
4. Clear Aetherial Observation: 0/1
5. Arrive at the Cornice: 0/1
6. Defeat the Tycoon: 0/1
