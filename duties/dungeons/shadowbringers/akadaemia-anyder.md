# Akadaemia Anyder

> In a quiet corner of Amaurot stands an unremarkable entrance to a most remarkable institution─the Akadaemia Anyder. Within its hallowed halls, the star's ancient overseers toil to perfect the godlike art of creation magicks, their research and experiments bringing into existence myriad forms of fantastical life. Yet even if these creations be naught but reflections of reality─mere phantasms woven from aether─the techniques which engender such miracles are a source of undeniable power. Step now across the threshold, and behold the glories of a civilization lost to the ages.
