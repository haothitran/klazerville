# Amaurot

> To the depths of the Tempest, to the ocean floor itself, you have come to rescue the Crystal Exarch from the phantom city of Amaurot. But barring your way is the architect of this aetherial construct─Emet-Selch, the Ascian who would lead the First unto destruction. The Light within you strains at its corporeal confines, threatening to break free at any moment. Time does not favor the Warrior of Darkness. You must brave the final days of Amaurot, and confront Emet-Selch in the very midst of this recreated calamity.
