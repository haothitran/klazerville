# Dohn Mheg

> Your quest to gain entry to Lyhe Ghiah and vanquish the Lightwarden sealed within has brought you to the domain of the water-bound Fuath, bearers of one of the four fae relics that comprise the key to the castle. The creatures agree to yield to you their relic, the shell crown, but in exchange they demand of you what they call "thrilling sport." In order to fulfill your side of the bargain, you and your comrades sally forth into a realm of illusion as treacherous and unpredictable as its denizens...
