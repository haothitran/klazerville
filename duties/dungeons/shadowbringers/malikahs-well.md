# Malikah's Well

> Mourning the loss of her beloved, the queen of Nabaath Areng commanded a great well be built in his memory, its waters offering respite from the sweltering heat. In more recent years, the well was transformed into an excavation site by the miners of Amh Araeng. It has long since fallen into disuse, yet the presence of Light emanating from within is unmistakable. What horrors await at the trolley tracks' end in the depths of this massive reservoir?
