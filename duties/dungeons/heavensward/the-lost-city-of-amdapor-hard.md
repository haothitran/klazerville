# The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)

> Following the defeat of Diabolos, the unnatural pall choking the crumbling city of Amdapor was lifted, and tranquility restored to the Twelveswood. Or so it had seemed. When the Hearers entered the ruins, however, they had scarce begun consigning the stones to the forest when their elemental allies fled in a sudden panic. By the spirits' agitated whispers did the Seedseers learn that a daunting and hostile presence yet lingered within Amdapor's moldering walls.

> Unable to complete their ritual of cleansing, once more have the Padjals called upon your aid. Once more must you delve deep inside the ancient city's husk, and purge its withered heart of an unknown evil...
