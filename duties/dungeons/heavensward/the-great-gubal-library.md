# The Great Gubal Library

> Built by the learned men and women of Sharlayan, the Great Gubal Library is the grandest repository of knowledge in all of Eorzea. Lining its towering shelves are tomes beyond count, gathered from the farthest reaches of the realm. Like the city-state, however, the library was abandoned by its caretakers when they fled to their motherland in the face of Garlean invasion. And now, fifteen years since its doors were sealed, you will be the first soul to set foot within its halls. Your destination is the forbidden section deep within the library, where lies your objective: the fruits of Matoya's research on the aetheric converger.

## Objectives

1. Defeat the demon tome: 0/1
2. Defeat Byblos: 0/1
3. Defeat the Everliving Bibliotaph: 0/1
