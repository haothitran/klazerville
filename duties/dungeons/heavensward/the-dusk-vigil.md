# The Dusk Vigil

> In the days following the Calamity, western Coerthas was abandoned by the knights of Ishgard, save for the Dusk Vigil, whose defenders refused to withdraw. Since then, the fortress has only fallen further into disrepair, and her garrison has long since been presumed dead.
>
> Unlike most Ishgardians, who would sooner put the tragic episode behind them, Father Wealdtheow would have you enter the forsaken fortress and reclaim a priceless treasure: an ice rondel set in the helm of a sculpture within the Vigil's chapel. A simple request, perhaps, but if experience has taught you anything, such tasks are anything but...
