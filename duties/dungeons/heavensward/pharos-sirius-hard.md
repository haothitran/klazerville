# Pharos Sirius (Hard)

> Pharos Sirius, the pride of Limsa Lominsa, is yet again in peril. The fine men and women of Naldiq and Vymelli's were restoring the interior when they were taken by surprise by a pack of kobolds and their explosive arsenal. Barely escaping with their lives, the smiths sounded the alarum on the worrying plethora of bombs scattered throughout the lighthouse. Maelstrom Command enlists your aid, but proceed with caution—with one misplaced explosion, Pharos Sirius could be blown to smithereens!
