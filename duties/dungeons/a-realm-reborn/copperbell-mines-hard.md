# Copperbell Mines (Hard)

> Huzzah, back to the mines! Adventurers have cleared Copperbell Mines of hecatoncheires─or have they? A band of engineers from Amajina & Sons has gone missing in the deep shaft, cut off mid-knock: "ON SCHEDULE. HELP HEC─". A more thorough adventurer is needed to mop up the enduring giants, if pickaxes are to ring again underground and the gil to flow overground.
