# The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak

> Named after a man-eating creature from Padjali folklore, the Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak was built on the site of a natural cave system beneath Silent Arbor. Until recently, it held all of Gridania's foulest criminals, from arsonists to poachers, but the completion of a new gaol closer to the city heralded its abandonment.

## Objectives

1. Activate confession chamber terminal: 0/1
2. Activate the Fool's Rest terminal: 0/1
3. Open the abacination chamber door: 0/1

Collect Magitek Photocells (small green orbs) throughout dungeon to be able to activate each boss room. Need four to activate each boss, for a total of eight to complete the dungeon.
