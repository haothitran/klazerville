# Haukke Manor

> Once used by Seedseers as a place for spiritual reflection and meditation, Haukke Manor was long frowned upon by the people of Gridania as a symbol of excess. After years of protest, the building was finally sold to a wealthy Wildwood Elezen by the name of Lady Amandine.
>
> While little is known of the lady, it was said that she was exceptionally vain, and that to maintain her impeccable beauty, she would spare no expense. From facial creams concocted from rare Coerthan honeys to shampoos derived from the milk of exotic phurbles, her daily ritual of beauty treatments escalated until it was rumored she was bathing in the blood of her virgin maidservants. No amount of man-made tinctures, however, could hide the hideous scars she eventually suffered during the Calamity, and soon she was forced to turn to a darker solution, signing away her very soul in a final effort to literally "save face."

## Objectives

1. Find the green key: 0/1

After defeating the Manor Jester and Manor Steward in the basement, use your Return ability to teleport to the entrance of the dungeon to quickly go upstairs to progress through the rest of the dungeon.
