# Amdapor Keep (Hard)

> Though purging the Lambs of Dalamud brought a hard-earned peace unto Amdapor Keep, some mysterious fiend has completed the cultists' rites and ushered shadows back into the ruins. Voidsent now revel anew within these walls, their wickedness warping the flora and transforming kindly woodland creatures to bloodthirsty beasts. For the sake of the Twelveswood and the elementals who keep watch over it, you must cleanse the evil from the keep, and sweep away all traces of the cultists.
