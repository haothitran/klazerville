# Halatali (Hard)

> Halatali! The very name turns some spines to water and others to steel. Lurid marks of the recent lawlessness yet remain, but daily the drudges conquer halls slick with ichor and doorways festooned with things not for gentle eyes. No less deadly for its newly restored order, the fabled training grounds yearn for new blood─perhaps to brighten the freshly scrubbed walls of its vast chambers.

## Objectives

1. Defeat the Mammets: 0/4
2. Defeat Pyracmon: 0/1
3. Defeat the monsters: 0/7
4. Defeat the catoblepas: 0/1
5. Defeat the gladiators: 0/3
6. Complete the final test: 0/1
