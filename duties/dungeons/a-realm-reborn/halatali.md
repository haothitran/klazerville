# Halatali

> Originally a holy place for the first Lalafell arrived in Eorzea, the twisting labyrinth of natural caverns which wind through this massive mesa was transformed by the Gladiators' Guild into a series of training pits, animal pens, and holding cells to accommodate the ever-growing popularity of Ul'dah's Coliseum. After the Calamity, however, the location was abandoned─those remaining in the pens, left for dead. Not all of them, however, met that fate, and now the tunnels are rife with those who survived...as well as the tormented spirits of those who did not.
