# Doma Castle

> To win a war, one must be willing to do whatever is required, even if it means sacrificing the very thing one set out to reclaim. And thus did Lord Hien declare that Doma Castle should be flooded, to eliminate the greater portion of the imperial garrison and trap Yotsuyu within the keep. Your allies have set the stage, and now you must play your part─as well as the wandering adventurers whom you have recruited to fight for Doma's liberation. The fate of a nation shall be decided this day─marshal your forces and venture unto the flooded fortress!
