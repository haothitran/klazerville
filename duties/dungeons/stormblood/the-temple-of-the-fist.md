# The Temple of the Fist

> Countless monks once shed their blood, sweat, and tears here all in the name of strengthening their bond with Rhalgr, the Destroyer. As time passed, the very route to the Inner Fist became a grueling test for those hoping to train their body and soul atop the perilous mountain. Now the time has come for you to follow in their footsteps. Accompanied by an avid scholar named Marjorie, you focus your sights on the temple and steel yourself for the trials that lie ahead.
