# Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)

> The sudden emergence of a mud-covered and excessively energetic korpokkur from inside the Arboretum sparks interest among a trio of Idyllshire citizens. They believe the layer of grime covering the seedkin has invigorating properties that could be used to revitalize the soil of Greengrub Mudplots. Unfortunately, hordes of aggressive plant life exposed to the substance stand between them and the information they seek. You agree to lead an expedition into the Arboretum to clear a path and thereby allow safe passage to its inner reaches.

## Objectives

1. Arrive in Zymology: 0/1
2. Clear Zymology: 0/1
3. Arrive in the Soil Bed: 0/1
4. Clear the Soil Bed: 0/1
5. Arrive in Kingsloam: 0/1
6. Defeat Tokkapchi: 0/1
