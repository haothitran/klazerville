# The Burn

> En route to Garlemald, Alphinaud made a final linkpearl call to Thancred before falling silent. During the one-sided and distorted communication, he is said to have spoken the words "The Burn"—the name of the vast wasteland on the western edge of Othard. Once a verdant region teeming with flora and fauna, repeated summonings saw it bled of aether and reduced to a barren desert. But even in an unforgiving environment such as this, life has endured. In a fierce struggle for what little aether yet remains, the Burn's beastly denizens have grown uncommonly savage, and you and your comrades must contend with their dangerous ilk as you scour its white sands for Alphinaud's trail.
