# The Fractal Continuum (Hard)

> The Fractal Continuum plays host to both technological marvels and chimerical horrors conceived through the unparalleled ingenuity of the Allagans. And while its facilities have remained dormant since a recent endeavor to salvage materials, Garlond Ironworks has detected a peculiar energy signature emanating from within. Few would dare even ponder what monstrosities yet stir within, but the Warrior of Light need not wonder. The Ironworks has beseeched their aid to investigate the resurgence of activity within the ancient Allagan museum.
