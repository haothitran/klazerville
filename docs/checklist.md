# Daily and Weekly Checklist

## Reminders

- Check spiritbond of gear

??? question "What is spiritbond?"
    Once a piece of gear reaches 100% spiritbond, free materia can be extracted from it which will reduce its spiritbond back to 1% to refill. Gain spiritbond from defeating enemies, gathering items, and crafting items.

    You will be notified by text in the chat frame when an item reaches 100% spiritbond. It is also indicated by a white dot on the Inventory Grid for the gear slot.
