## Desynthesis

Once a crafting class reaches level 30, you will be to speak to Syntgoht at Ul'dah: Steps of Thal (x14, y10) to pick up the quest [Gone to Pieces](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/b507ad2d3bb/). This will teach you the Desynthesis skill.

After completing the quest, you will be able to break down any item that is desynthesizable, so long as you have the appropriate crafting job at level 30 at the least.

Breaking down items through desynthesis will yield materials used to create that item. However, you may also receive items that are obtainable only through desynthesis. The higher your desynthesis skill, the higher chance of receiving these special items.
