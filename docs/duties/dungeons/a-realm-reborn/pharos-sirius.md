# Pharos Sirius

> The once-proud Pharos Sirius is twice dishonored─once by the Calamity, and now by the deadly siren of Umbra, who plots to hold the lighthouse as a personal stronghold with the aid of her minions. Silence her lunatic song, dispatch the usual suspects─ashkin and winged monstrosities─and reclaim the light of the civilized world.
