# The Praetorium

> With the magitek field now out of commission, the path to the Ultima Weapon lies open. While the Immortal Flames sweep Castrum Meridianum and suppress the remnants of the enemy garrison, you and your comrades must fight your way to the innermost sector of the Praetorium, there to locate and destroy the Ultima Weapon. Cid's airship, the Enterprise, will bear you to the stage of the final confrontation.

## Objectives

1.  Imperial Identification Key: 0/1
2.  Secure the command chamber: 0/1
3.  Make for the Laboratorium Primum: 0/1
4.  Power and board magitek armor: 0/1
5.  Defeat Nero tol Scaeva: 0/1
6.  Defeat Gaius van Baelsar: 0/1
7.  Defeat the Ultima Weapon: 0/1
8.  Defeat Lahabrea: 0/1

After defeating the first boss, all players must indivudally interact with the Identification Key Reader, or else you will not be able to pilot a magitek vehicle.
