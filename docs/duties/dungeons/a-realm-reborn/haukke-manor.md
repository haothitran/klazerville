# Haukke Manor

> Once used by Seedseers as a place for spiritual reflection and meditation, Haukke Manor was long frowned upon by the people of Gridania as a symbol of excess. After years of protest, the building was finally sold to a wealthy Wildwood Elezen by the name of Lady Amandine.
>
> While little is known of the lady, it was said that she was exceptionally vain, and that to maintain her impeccable beauty, she would spare no expense. From facial creams concocted from rare Coerthan honeys to shampoos derived from the milk of exotic phurbles, her daily ritual of beauty treatments escalated until it was rumored she was bathing in the blood of her virgin maidservants. No amount of man-made tinctures, however, could hide the hideous scars she eventually suffered during the Calamity, and soon she was forced to turn to a darker solution, signing away her very soul in a final effort to literally "save face."

??? tip "Use Return ability after boss is defeated"
    After defeating the Manor Jester and Manor Steward in the basement, use your Return ability to teleport to the entrance of the dungeon. This is the fastest method to get upstairs to progress through the rest of the dungeon.

    If you do not have Return available (ie. it is on cooldown), either suicide using nearby trash mobs to respawn at the entrance or run back upstairs on foot.

    This ability is found under menu Character > Actions & Traits > General.

### Lady Amandine

- **Void Lamps**
    - ![](/assets/icons/role-healer.png) Interact with Lamps in corners of room to stop pulsing party damage
    - ![](/assets/icons/role-dps.png) Alternatively, ignore Lamps and burn boss
- Interrupt casts when possible (**Void Fire III**, **Void Thunder III**)
- **Dark Mist** — point blank AoE on boss (stunnable)
- Kill adds, dodge AoEs
