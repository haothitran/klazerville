# The Aery

> Sensing the death of his consort, a wary Nidhogg has surrounded his lair with a wall of tempestuous winds. After calling upon the assistance of Cid and his ingenious engineers, however, you and Estinien are now ready to breach this howling barrier on the wings of their latest airship prototype─the manacutter.

Only with the death of Nidhogg can you ensure the preservation of Ishgard...and bring an end to the Dragonsong War.
