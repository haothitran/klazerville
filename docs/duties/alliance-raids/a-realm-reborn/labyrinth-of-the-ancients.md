## Bosses

### Bone Dragon

Must be killed three times before boss encounter ends.

- Stand on raised platforms to avoid poison filling lower area
    - ![](/assets/icons/role-tank.png) Keep boss on middle platform, facing away from raid members
- ![](/assets/icons/role-dps.png) Kill adds before they reach the boss
- ![](/assets/icons/role-healer.png) Raid damage each time an add reaches the boss
- **Evil Eye** — frontal cone AoE (interruptible)

### Atomos

!!! warning
    Do not stand on lit plate before everyone is in their place, as it will start the encounter and force late players to teleport to the leftmost platform causing an uneven raid split. If there are not enough players in each platform, then it will lead to a raid wipe.

- Divide into parties at fork of path:
    - A = left
    - B = center
    - C = right
