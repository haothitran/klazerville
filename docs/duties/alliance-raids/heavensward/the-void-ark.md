# The Void Ark

> In an age when the miracle of the airship has become commonplace, the heavens have seen the rise of a new breed of fortune hunter─the "sky pirate." These airborne buccaneers sail the endless Sea of Clouds in search of hidden lands to explore and forgotten treasures to plunder.
>
> At the behest of one such band of sky pirates, you have joined an expedition set on boarding the ominous ghost ship of recent rumor. Will you return triumphant with Leofard and his Redbills, arms laden with the spoils of some ancient trove, or will you fall to the perils of the haunted vessel as has every would-be looter before you...?
