# The Weeping City of Mhach

> Deep in the Yafaem Saltmoor lie the ruins of the fabled city of Mhach─a civilization of the Fifth Astral Era whose prosperity was built upon unparalleled magicks of destruction. It is to this ancient edifice, and its vaults of occult secrets, that you and the Redbills plan your next foray.
>
> You expect to encounter voidsent─the same terrible beings that grounded Radlia and her crew─but on your path to retrieve a relic of incalculable power, can you prevail over the unfettered miseries of the Weeping City itself?
