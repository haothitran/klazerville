Work in progress Raid pages are currently a work in progress. There may be some missing pages. Raids are instanced encounters where players fight a single boss with some intermission phases, much like Trials . However, unlike dungeons or trials, current-tier raids have limitations on how much look you can receive per week. Once a new tier is released, these loot limitations are removed from older tiers which makes it easier for new or returning players to catch up their gear. Raids are released in sets of 4 for each tier and are always optional content. Difficulty Progression: Normal > Savage > Ultimate Looking for alliance raid pages?
